# Why here?

I'm starting on a leisure project aiming at exporting or even syncing articles of content blocks (used in e.g. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/what-is-a-block), [LarkSuite](https://open.larksuite.com/document/server-docs/docs/docs/docx-v1/guide)) into MDX format. Thus, this personal landing website, along with [this website in Chinese](https://docs-vocs.cquqian.li), will be served as **testing grounds** for any possible compoents and `vocs` framework itself. **No** timetable is set for this project though, since I have lots of sudden inspirations everyday. It takes time to validate whether it's fun and pratical for me to jump in ⬇️ 

Some archived but great projects are also listed here. Maybe you can also find inspirations from or connections with other peoples?

## Projects

### Akumazon

We ([@doodledu](https://doodledu22.com), [@Anisichael](https://space.bilibili.com/108732461), @zouzhouzz) didn't voted for "Summoning" at all but managed to made a game about it. Or to be specified, a story-telling game about several anxious villagers. Only specified monster(s) can be summoned by spells to help their unique inquiry.

Thanks to the time limit given, otherwise I need summon another flare monster to dry my body after the heavy storm that night. Already applied a monster for the naughty cat Baga around the office.

WIP for our design document, and cats pictures.

### Projects in Incubator

* Facts: Along with Industrial Innovation Park in Chongqing, a formation like Xbot park. [Their earliest news in English.](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/chongqing/liangjiang/2022-02/25/content_37550044.htm)

WIP

### Parameter based STM32 Controller

* Source: [rm-micro-controllers](https://github.com/cquqianli/rm-micro-controllers)

WIP

### Others

* Typst template - [modern-cqu-thesis](https://github.com/Tiger3018/modern-cqu-thesis) is not fully up-to-date of my latest edit.

* [UE Plugin based on ConvAI](https://github.com/Tiger3018/AILAB-DigitalAvatar-UEPlugin) - My bachelor thesis project. No test unit or CI on top of the modifed codebase, but it's a good start for anyone who wants to build a local digital avatar in Unreal Engine.

* [wsl2-kernel-patch-config](https://github.com/Tiger3018/wsl2-kernel-patch-config) - A simple CI to patch WSL2 kernel with camera support, resulting in releases. Can be used to enable real-time and more features? (See also [my another CI without remaining artifacts](https://github.com/automated-mirror/linux-stable-rt))

* [stm32cubemonitor-elfparser](https://github.com/Tiger3018/stm32cubemonitor-elfparser) - Fix the C++ styled bin format parser error in `@stm32/stm32cubemonitor-elfparser@1.2.0`, ported with the cubemonitor software.
